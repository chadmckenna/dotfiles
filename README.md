Requirements
------------

Set zsh as your login shell:

    chsh -s $(which zsh)

Install
-------

Clone onto your laptop:

    git clone git://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles.git

(Or, [fork and keep your fork
updated](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/keeping-a-github-fork-updated)).

Install [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm):

    brew bundle dotfiles/Brewfile

Install:

    rcup -d dotfiles -x README.md -x LICENSE -x Brewfile

This will create symlinks for config files in your home directory. The `-x`
options, which exclude the `README.md`, `LICENSE`, and `Brewfile` files, are
needed during installation but can be skipped once the `.rcrc` configuration
file is symlinked in.

You can safely run `rcup` multiple times to update:

    rcup

Make your own customizations
----------------------------

Put your customizations in dotfiles appended with `.local`:

* `~/.aliases.local`
* `~/.gitconfig.local`
* `~/.gvimrc.local`
* `~/.tmux.conf.local`
* `~/.vimrc.local`
* `~/.vimrc.bundles.local`
* `~/.zshrc.local`

For example, your `~/.aliases.local` might look like this:

    # Productivity
    alias todo='$EDITOR ~/.todo'

Your `~/.gitconfig.local` might look like this:

    [alias]
      l = log --pretty=colored
    [pretty]
      colored = format:%Cred%h%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)%an%Creset
    [user]
      name = Dan Croak
      email = dan@thoughtbot.com

Your `~/.zshrc.local` might look like this:

    # recommended by brew doctor
    export PATH="/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:$PATH"

Your `~/.vimrc.bundles.local` might look like this:

    Bundle 'Lokaltog/vim-powerline'
    Bundle 'stephenmckinney/vim-solarized-powerline'

What's in it?
-------------

[vim](http://www.vim.org/) configuration:

* [Ctrl-P](https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim) for fuzzy file/buffer/tag finding.
* [Rails.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-rails) for enhanced navigation of
  Rails file structure via `gf` and `:A` (alternate), `:Rextract` partials,
  `:Rinvert` migrations, etc.
* Run [RSpec](https://www.relishapp.com/rspec) specs from vim.
* Set `<leader>` to a single space.
* Switch between the last two files with space-space.
* Syntax highlighting for CoffeeScript, Textile, Cucumber, Haml, Markdown, and
  HTML.
* Use [Ag](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) instead of Grep when
  available.
* Use [Exuberant Ctags](http://ctags.sourceforge.net/) for tab completion.
* Use [GitHub color scheme](https://github.com/croaky/vim-colors-github).
* Use [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/vundle) to manage plugins.

[tmux](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/a-tmux-crash-course)
configuration:

* Improve color resolution.
* Remove administrative debris (session name, hostname, time) in status bar.
* Set prefix to `Ctrl+a` (like GNU screen).
* Soften status bar color from harsh green to light gray.

* Add trusted binstubs to the `PATH`.
* Load rbenv into the shell, adding shims onto our `PATH`.

Shell aliases and scripts:

* `m` for `rake db:migrate && rake db:rollback && rake db:migrate && rake db:test:prepare`.
* `mcd` to make a directory and change into it.
* `rake` is `zeus rake` if using [Zeus](https://github.com/burke/zeus) on the
  project in current directory.
* `replace foo bar **/*.rb` to find and replace within a given list of files.
